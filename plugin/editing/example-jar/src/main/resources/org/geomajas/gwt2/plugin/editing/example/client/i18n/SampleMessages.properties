customEdit=Custom
editPolygonCustomEdit=Edit an existing Polygon geometry, using a custom validator that allows no more than 6 points

editingTitle=Geometry editing
editingShort=Shows the possibilities of the geometry editing plugin.
editingDescription=This example demonstrates the possibilities of the geometry editing plugin.

generalCreate=Create
generalEdit=Edit
generalStopEditing=Stop editing
generalSuspend=Suspend editing
generalResume=Resume editing
generalExplanation=The following list lays out your options (when using "Create", these options will only work once you have double clicked):<ul><li>You can drag the vertices about</li><li>When dragging a vertex over an adjacent one, you can release to delete it (it will become red to signal this event).</li><li>By clicking on the edges, you can still insert additional vertices.</li></ul>

# EditPointPanel:
editPointTitle=Editing point geometries
editPointShort=Shows how to create or edit point geometries. 
editPointDescription=This example demonstrates how to create or edit point geometries. Choose one of the options to start the geometry editing process.
editPointSubTitle=Editing Points
editPointCreate=Create a new Point geometry from scratch: Just click somewhere on the map.
editPointEdit=Start editing an existing Point geometry. This geometry will lie in the center of the map.

# EditLinePanel:
editLineTitle=Editing LineString geometries
editLineShort=Shows how to create or edit LineString geometries. 
editLineDescription=This example demonstrates how to create or edit LineString geometries. Choose one of the options to start the geometry editing process.
editLineSubTitle=Editing linestrings
editLineCreate=Create a new LineString geometry from scratch: Start clicking on the map. Double click to stop inserting more points.
editLineEdit=Start editing an existing LineString geometry.

# EditPolygonPanel:
editPolygonTitle=Editing Polygon geometries
editPolygonShort=Shows how to create or edit Polygon geometries. 
editPolygonDescription=This example demonstrates how to create or edit Polygon geometries. Choose one of the options to start the geometry editing process.
editPolygonSubTitle=Editing Polygons
editPolygonCreate=Create a new Polygon geometry from scratch: Start clicking on the map. Close to stop inserting vertices.
editPolygonEdit=Start editing an existing Polygon geometry.
editPolygonAddRing=Add inner ring

# UndoRedoPanel:
undoRedoTitle=Using undo/redo while editing
undoRedoShort=Shows how to use the undo/redo functionalities of the geometry editing service. 
undoRedoDescription=This example demonstrates the use of the undo and redo functionalities provided by the GeometryEditService. Start building a geometry and use the undo/redo buttons to retrace your changes.
undoRedoSubTitle=Undo and redo

# SnapToCountriesPanel: 
snapToCountriesTitle=Snapping to features while editing
snapToCountriesShort=Shows how snapping can be used to snap vertices to the features of a vector layer.
snapToCountriesDescription=This example demonstrates the use of snapping while editing. In this particular case, we use the features of the Countries layer to snap to.
snapToCountriesSubtitle=Snapping to countries
snapToCountriesOnOff=Turn snapping on/off
snapToCountriesDistance=Snapping distance (in meters):

# SplitCountryPanel:
splitCountryTitle=Polygon splitting
splitCountryShort=Shows how to select a feature from the Countries layer and split it using a custom splitting line.
splitCountryDescription=This example demonstrates how to use the geometry splitting functionality in the editing plugin. It lets the user select a country, then draw a splitting line, and finally split the country in pieces.
splitCountrySubTitle=Split a country of your choice
splitCountrySelect=First, select a country on the map by clicking on it.
splitCountryDraw=Now draw a line (doubleclick to stop adding points) to indicate how to split the country.
splitCountrySplit=Execute splitting!

# MergeCountriesPanel:
mergeCountriesTitle=Polygon merging
mergeCountriesShort=Shows how to select feature from the Countries layer and then merge them.
mergeCountriesDescription=This example demonstrates how to use the geometry merging service in the editing plugin. It lets the user select a few adjacent countries and the create a mathematical union.
mergeCountriesSubTitle=Merge countries
mergeCountriesSelect=<ul style="padding-left:20px;"><li>Select a few countries on the map using "shift + click".</li><li>Select at least 2 Countries.</li><li>Finally hit the "Execute merge!" button.</li></ul>
mergeCountriesMerge=Execute merge!


# GeometryValidationPanel:
geometryValidationTitle=Geometry Validation
geometryValidationShort=Shows how validity of geometry can be monitored on creation and editing
geometryValidationDescription=This example demonstrates what validation events are thrown on creating or editing a geometry. A user can listen to this events and react accordingly, e.g.: show an appropriate message to the user.\
</br>In this example, validation is turned on. This means a validation event is thrown on every kind of validation violation. The type of violation is indicated in the left hand bottom of the window.
geometryValidationSubTitle=Validate polygon
geometryValidationSubTitleEvents=Validation Events
geometryValidationClearEventList=Clear event list
