/**
 * <p>
 * Central service for all operations concerning the geometry editing process. This process should work together with a
 * set of controllers on the map that execute methods from this service after which events are fired for a renderer to
 * act upon. Note that this service uses the {@link GeometryIndexService} to identify sub-geometries, vertices and
 * edges, and that all operations work on a set of such indices. This allows for great flexibility in the operations
 * that can be performed on geometries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This service also extends the {@link GeometryIndexOperationService} service, which defines possible operations on
 * geometries during the editing process. Operations can be stand alone or can be part of an operation sequence. Using
 * an operations sequence wherein multiple operations are executed will be regarded as a single operation unit for the
 * undo and redo methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Know also that operations onto the geometry really do apply on the same geometry that was passed with the
 * <code>start</code> method. In other words, this service does change the original geometry. If you want to support
 * some roll-back functionality within your code, make sure to create a clone of the geometry before starting this edit
 * service.
 * </p>
