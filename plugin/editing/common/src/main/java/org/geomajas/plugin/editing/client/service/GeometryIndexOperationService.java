/**
 * <p>
 * Service definition that defines possible operations on geometries during the editing process. Operations can be stand
 * alone or can be part of an operation sequence. Using an operations sequence wherein multiple operations are executed
 * will be regarded as a single operation unit for the undo and redo methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Take for example the moving of a vertex on the map. The user might drag a vertex over a lot of pixels, but every
 * intermediary change is executed as an operation (otherwise no events would be thrown and the renderer on the map
 * wouldn't know there was a change). When the user finally releases the vertex, dozens of move operations might already
 * have been executed. If the user would now have to click an undo button dozens of times to get the vertex back to it's
 * original position, that would not be very user-friendly.<br/>
 * On such occasions, an operation sequence would be used so that those dozens move operations are regarded as a single
 * unit, undone with a single call to undo.
