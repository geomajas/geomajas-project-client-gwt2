    <title>Further Configuration</title>

    <para>As with most Geomajas plugins, the geocoder plugin has a single class
    that provides access to all the configurable functionalities within the
    plugin:</para>

    <programlisting>org.geomajas.gwt2.plugin.geocoder.client.Geocoder</programlisting>

	   <para>This class provides access to the client bundle factory and view factory that are used
		   in the creation of the Geocoder Widget. Both factories can be overwritten by customized classes.</para>
