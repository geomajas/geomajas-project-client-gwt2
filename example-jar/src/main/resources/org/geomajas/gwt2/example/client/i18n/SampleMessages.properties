generalNavOptionTitle=Navigation options
generalNavOptionShort=Options such as animated navigation etc.
generalNavOptionDescription=This example demonstrates some options for navigating the map. How to turn the animated navigation on or off, etc.
generalResizeMapTitle=Custom map resizing
generalResizeMapShort=This example shows map resizing capabilities.
generalResizeMapDescription=This example shows map resizing capabilities.
generalMapFillTitle=Full screen map
generalMapFillShort=This example demonstrates a map that fills the available space in the layout.
generalMapFillDescription=This example shows how to let the map fill up an area on the page. By using the default GWT layout system, Geomajas provides a MapLayout widget that will automatically fill up the available space with a map.
generalVpEventTitle=ViewPort Events
generalVpEventShort=This example shows the events that accompany the changes to the visible area of the map.
generalVpEventDescription=This example shows the events that accompany the changes to the view port or visible area of the map.<br/>Events are fired when the view port is translated (panning),scaled (zooming) or changed in a non-trivial way (e.g resize).
generalServerExceptionTitle=Server error message
generalServerExceptionShort=This example shows dialog for a server-side generated exception. 
generalServerExceptionDescription=This example shows how a server-side error should look like. By pressing the button, a command is executed that then throws an exception. This exception is than shown on the client.
generalListnerTitle=Using map event listeners
generalListnerShort=This examples shows how to add a native event listener that displays the mouse coordinates.
generalListnerDescription=A listener is a passive controller on the map. It is notified of native HTML events, but cannot interfere with their operations. It can only react in a passive way. This sample shows how to use such a passive listener to print out mouse move coordinates.
generalListnerScreenPosition=Screen position:
generalListnerWorldPosition=World position:
generalListnerSubtitle=Listening to mouse move events:
generalControlsTitle=Alternative Map Controls
generalControlsShort=Shows alternative control widgets for panning and zooming on the map.
generalControlsDescription=This sample demonstrates how to replace the default map control widgets with more advanced alternatives. When writing your own applications, you could use this to provide your own map control widgets.
generalTraceNavigationTitle=Navigation tracing
generalTraceNavigationShort=Traces the map bounds while navigating
generalTraceNavigationDescription=This animated sample shows a canvas rectangle for each bounding box in the navigation trajectory. Requires canvas support in the browser !

# Category: Layers
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
layerAddRemoveTitle=Adding & removing layers
layerAddRemoveShort=This example shows how to add layers to the map and remove them again.
layerAddRemoveDescription=Example that demonstrates the ability to add layers to/remove layers from the map.
layerOrderTitle=Changing layer order
layerOrderShort=Example that demonstrates the ability to change layer order.
layerOrderDescription=Example that demonstrates the ability to change layer order. Try dragging the labels up and down.
layerVisibilityTitle=Layer visibility
layerVisibilityShort=This example shows the events that accompany the toggling of a layers visibility.
layerVisibilityDescription=This example shows the events that accompany the toggling of a layers visibility.<br/>Note that the "countries" layer has been configured to be visible only on medium scale levels. When zooming too far in or out, the countries layer will never be visible.
layerRefreshTitle=Layer refresh
layerRefreshShort=Layer refreshing will completely redraw the layer on the map.
layerRefreshDescription=This example shows the layer refresh functionality. A refresh means that a layers contents are discarded and fetched anew. This also results in a redraw on the map.
layerOpacityTitle=Layer opacity
layerOpacityShort=The example demonstrates a layers transparency setting.
layerOpacityDescription=The example demonstrates a layers transparency setting. At this moment only server-side raster layers can use the opacity setting, while vector layers use a more general styling.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Category: Features (Title Short Description)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
featureSelectionTitle=Feature Selection
featureSelectionShort=Demonstration of the default selection controller.
featureSelectionDescription=This example demonstrates the use of the FeatureSelectionController. This controller allows the user to select features on the map.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Category: Rendering
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
renderingInteractionTitle=Drawing interaction
renderingInteractionShort=Adding user interaction to custom rendered objects.
renderingInteractionDescription=This example shows how to add custom user interaction on custom drawings. In this particular case a rectangle is drawn that can be dragged around.
renderingScreenSpaceTitle=Drawing in screen space
renderingScreenSpaceShort=Custom rendering using pixel coordinates
renderingScreenSpaceDescription=This example shows the vector object drawing capabilities of the Geomajas map. In this particular example, all objects are rendered in screen space. For more information regarding screen space and world space, visit the javadocs.
renderingWorldSpaceTitle=Drawing in world space
renderingWorldSpaceShort=Custom rendering of the map coordinate system
renderingWorldSpaceDescription=This example shows the vector object drawing capabilities of the Geomajas map. In this particular example, all objects are rendered in world space. For more information regarding screen space and world space, visit the javadocs. Try navigating the map to see the difference with screen space.
renderingWorldSpaceFixedTitle=Drawing in world space (fixed size)
renderingWorldSpaceFixedShort=Custom rendering positioning in map CRS while keeping fixed size
renderingWorldSpaceFixedDescription=This example shows the fixed size rendering of vector objects in world space. For more information regarding screen space and world space, visit the javadocs.<br/>Notice that unlike normal world space rendering the objects retain their size, while still keeping their position in world space.
renderingMissingCanvas=No canvas support in this browser !
renderingCanvasTitle=Drawing on HTML5 canvas
renderingCanvasShort=Drawing of geometry and rectangular shapes on canvas
renderingCanvasDescription=This example shows high-performance canvas rendering of 1000 geometries and more !
markerPanelTitle=Drawing markers in world space
markerPanelShort=Drawing HTML markers in world space
markerPanelDescription=This example shows drawing of TransformableWidget objects in world space. These are plain GWT widgets which have a fixed position and (optionally) size in world space. Typically used for HTML call-outs, markers, etc...
